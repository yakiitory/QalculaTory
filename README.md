A scientific calculator that handles infix notation and evaluates into answers, written in C/C++ with Qt. It makes use of the Shunting Yard Algorithm in parsing infix notation to postfix notation / Reverse Polish Notation, a notation that computers can understand. Users can input an equation onto the text field or use the GUI buttons and then receive an output after pressing the equals button. It supports math functions shown in the GUI. The name is a pun on the username 'yakiitory', calculator, and the Qt framework.
